se with added rowData column
}
\description{
Add column to rowData that specifies for each row if values are missing at random or
not (MAR vs MNAR). The method is very rudimentary:
\enumerate{
\item Missing values are replaced by zeros, measured values by 1.
\item ANOVA between conditions is performed to determine significant differences
of the mean.
\item Rows with p-values < 0.05 are termed missing not at random.
}
