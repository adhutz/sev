\title{AOV Scale PhosR Function}
\usage{
aov_scale_phosR(ppe, p_cut = 0.05, fc_cut = 0.5, assay = "normalised")
}
\arguments{
\item{ppe}{A ppe object.}

\item{p_cut}{A numeric threshold for selecting rows based on ANOVA p-value (default: 0.05).}

\item{fc_cut}{A numeric threshold for selecting rows based on fold change (default: 0.5).}

\item{assay}{A character specifying the assay to use from ppe (default: "normalised").}
}
\value{
A ppe object with the transformed data added as a new assay named "z_scored".
}
\description{
This function takes a ppe object and applies a series of transformations,
including mean abundance calculation, ANOVA filtering, subsetting, standardization,
and z-scoring. The transformed data is then added as a new assay to the ppe object.
