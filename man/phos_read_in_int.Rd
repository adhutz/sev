\arguments{
\item{file}{A string representing the file path of the tab-delimited phosphoproteomics data.}

\item{gene_column}{A string representing the name of the gene column in the input data. Default is "gene_names".}

\item{protein_column}{A string representing the name of the protein column in the input data. Default is "proteins".}

\item{sep}{A string used as the separator for intensity columns in the input data. Default is "\emph{rep}".}

\item{filt}{A character vector containing the filters to apply for false and low-quality hits. Default is c("reverse", "potential_contaminant").}

\item{keep_all_proteins}{A boolean indicating whether to keep all proteins when splitting protein groups. Default is FALSE.}

\item{keep_all_genes}{A boolean indicating whether to keep all genes when splitting protein groups. Default is FALSE.}

\item{experimental_design}{A data.frame containing the experimental design information. Default is an empty string.}
}
\value{
A summarizedExperiment containing the phosphoproteomics data.
}
\description{
This function reads in phosphoproteomics data from the "Phospho (STY)Sites.txt" MaxQuant output, processes it by splitting protein groups,
filtering low-quality hits, and expanding the site table. It also creates site IDs and makes gene names unique. In the end, it returns a
SummarizedExperiment.
Experimental design can be provided or generated automatically if not provided.

# Assuming "Phospho (STY)Sites.txt" is a valid MaxQuant phosphoproteomics data file
