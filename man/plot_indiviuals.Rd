\usage{
plot_indiviuals(
  df,
  x,
  y,
  cut_x,
  cut_y,
  max.overlaps = 10,
  ctrl = "ctrl",
  scaled = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the data to be plotted.}

\item{x}{A string representing the column name for the x-axis variable (the difference between sample intensity and control mean).}

\item{y}{A string representing the column name for the y-axis variable (sample intensity).}

\item{cut_x}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for the x-axis variable, above which points are highlighted.}

\item{cut_y}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for the y-axis variable, above which points are highlighted.}

\item{max.overlaps}{A numeric value indicating the maximum number of overlapping labels for the text. Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{ctrl}{A string specifying the control condition name, used for labeling the plot. Defaults to \code{"ctrl"}.}

\item{scaled}{A logical value indicating whether the y-axis should be labeled as scaled. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the scatter plot with points color-coded based on whether they meet the threshold criteria. Points above the threshold are labeled with their \code{name}.
}
\description{
This function generates a scatter plot visualizing the difference between the intensity of a sample and the control mean for individual data points in a data frame. Points are colored based on whether they meet specified threshold criteria for both axes.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{ggplot2} to create a scatter plot where points are highlighted and labeled if they meet or exceed the specified \code{cut_x} and \code{cut_y} values. Labels for points are added using \code{geom_text_repel} to reduce overlap.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `df` is a valid data frame with relevant columns:
plot_indiviuals(df, x = "diff_sample1", y = "sample1", cut_x = 1, cut_y = 10)
