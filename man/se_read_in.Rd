Reads in MaxQuant or other output and creates a summarized experiment.}
\usage{
se_read_in(
  file,
  gene_column = "gene_names",
  protein_column = "protein_ids",
  sep = "_rep_",
  keep_all_proteins = F,
  keep_all_genes = F,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to proteinGroups or similar file}

\item{gene_column}{name of gene_name column after janitor}

\item{protein_column}{name of protein column after janitor}

\item{sep}{character describing the separator between sample name and replicate number (e.g. "\emph{rep}", "_r")}

\item{keep_all_proteins}{if FALSE, only first protein per protein-group is kept. If TRUE,
entries are split in multiple rows}

\item{keep_all_genes}{if FALSE, only first gene per protein-group is kept. If TRUE,
entries are split in multiple rows}

\item{experimental_design}{dataframe with information regarding samples. If not specified,
sample names and groups are read automatically (start with "lfq_intensity"), end with "_r" followed by
replicate number.}
}
\value{
