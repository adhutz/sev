\usage{
spectronaut_read_in(
  file,
  gene_column = "genes",
  protein_column = "uni_prot_ids",
  sep = "_rep_",
  keep_all_proteins = F,

}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to proteinGroups or similar file}

\item{gene_column}{name of gene_name column after janitor}

\item{protein_column}{name of protein column after janitor}

\item{sep}{character describing the separator between sample name and replicate number (e.g. "\emph{rep}", "_r")}

\item{keep_all_proteins}{if FALSE, only first protein per protein-group is kept. If TRUE,
entries are split in multiple rows}

\item{keep_all_genes}{if FALSE, only first gene per protein-group is kept. If TRUE,
entries are split in multiple rows}

\item{experimental_design}{dataframe with information regarding samples. If not specified,
sample names and groups are read automatically (start with "log2quantity_"), end with "_r" followed by
replicate number.}

\item{filt}{character vector of column names used for filtering. Genes with a "+" will be dropped.}
}
\value{
summarized experiment
}
\description{
